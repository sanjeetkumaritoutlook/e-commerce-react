----
Setting up the context properly in the root of your application is key when using Context API.
------
Key Points:
useCart Hook:

The useCart hook provides direct access to cart, addToCart, and removeFromCart.
Reusable Context:

The addToCart function can now be used in any component by simply calling useCart().
Confirmation:

The alert provides user feedback that the product has been added to the cart.
Mock Data:

Mocked product data is used instead of an actual API call.
---
Wrapping the Application:
Ensure that CartProvider wraps your app in index.js or the root component to make the context available globally.
Now, clicking the "Add to Cart" button will call the addToCart function and add the product to the cart state.
---------
Key Points:
Access the Cart:

Using useCart from the CartContext to get cart and removeFromCart.
Empty Cart Message:

If the cart is empty, it shows a message instead of the items.
Mapping Through Items:

Iterates over the cart array and displays each item's details.
Remove Item Functionality:

The removeFromCart method removes an item by its id.
Cart Total Calculation:

Computes the total price by multiplying price and quantity for each item in the cart.

Styling:
You can add CSS to make it visually appealing or use libraries like Material-UI or TailwindCSS for better design.
--
Key Points:
Navigation to Checkout:

In Cart.js, the "Proceed to Checkout" button uses useNavigate from React Router to navigate to the /checkout page.
Checkout Page:

The Checkout.js page has a simple form where the user can input their information (name, address, and email).
On form submission, an alert is displayed, simulating a successful order.

----
Next Steps:
You can further enhance the checkout page by adding validation for the form fields.
Connect it with an API or mock API to process the order.
Display order summary, payment options, etc.
----
make the search functionality work in your Header.js, you'll need to implement a few things:

Track the search query state using useState.
Handle the search when the user clicks the search button or presses enter.
Trigger a search action, which could be searching through an array of products or calling an API to get the results.

---Search query--
Explanation:
State Handling (useState):

searchQuery is used to store the value entered in the search input.
The setSearchQuery function updates the state whenever the user types in the input field.
Handling Search (handleSearch):

When the user clicks the "Search" button, the handleSearch function is triggered.
It checks if the searchQuery is not empty (searchQuery.trim()), and then filters the products array (assuming products is passed as a prop) to match the search query in the product names.
If a match is found, the filtered products are passed to the next step (e.g., navigating to a search results page or displaying the results).
Navigation (useNavigate):

The navigate function from React Router is used to programmatically navigate to a search results page, and we pass the filtered products as state so that we can display them on the results page.
---
Summary:
Search Query State: The searchQuery state stores the text input.
Filtering Products: The search function filters the products based on the query.
Display/Search Results: You can either navigate to a results page or display the filtered products within the same page.
-----
Ensure you are passing the products array from the parent component
In your parent component (e.g., App.js), make sure that you are passing the products data as a prop to Header.js.
Make sure products is properly destructured from the props in Header.js
In Header.js, make sure you are destructuring products from the props object correctly.
